\newacronym{PLP}{Postfix Log Parser}{description={
    Postfix Log Parser is the parser implementing the algorithm described
    in this thesis.
}}

\newacronym{DNSBL}{DNS Blacklist}{description={
    A DNS Blacklist~\cite{Wikipedia-DNSBL} is a simple collaborative
    anti-spam technique used to reject or penalise email sent from mail
    servers reported to have sent large volumes of spam.  To use a DNSBL
    the mail server makes a DNS request incorporating the IP address of the
    client; if the requested hostname exists the client is on the DNSBL,
    and the mail server can decide what course of action to take.
}}

\newacronym{API}{Application Programming Interface}{description={
    One of the fundamental concepts when writing programs is the reuse of
    existing code, so that each program does not reinvent the wheel.  When
    a body of code is intended to be reused repeatedly, the user of this
    code needs to be informed of the functionality provided by the code.
    An API defines the interface provided to the user, and acts as a
    contract between the user and the provider: if the user adheres to the
    API the provider guarantees it will work, but is free to change the
    implementation provided the API is preserved.

\newacronym{SMTP}{Simple Mail Transfer Protocol}{description={
    SMTP is the protocol that transfers mail from the sender to the
    recipient across the Internet.  It is a simple, human readable, plain
    text protocol, making it quite simple to test and debug problems with
    it.  A detailed description of \SMTP{} is beyond the scope of this
    document: the original protocol definition is \RFC{}~821~\cite{RFC821},
    updated in \RFC{}~2821~\cite{RFC2821}; introductory guides can be found
    at~\cite{smtp-intro-01,smtp-intro-02}.
}}

\newacronym{LMTP}{Local Mail Transfer Protocol}{description={
    LMTP is a protocol derived from SMTP that removes the need for the
    server to maintain a mail delivery queue, instead relying on the client
    to maintain it.  Typically the client is an MTA, and the server a
    delivery agent or a mail store.  Full details are available
    in~\cite{lmtp-rfc}.
}}

\newacronym{MTA}{Mail Transfer Agent}{description={
    A Mail Transfer Agent sends and receives mail via SMTP\backslashat{}.
    Users submit mail to an MTA via their mail client (e.g.\ Microsoft
    Outlook, Thunderbird, webmail services); the sending MTA transfers the
    mail to the receiving MTA (which may in turn forward it to another
    MTA).
}}

\newacronym{RFC}{Request For Comments}{description={
    The Request For Comments series is a series of proposals defining
    various protocols and file formats, e.g.\ SMTP\backslashat{}.  The name
    is somewhat misleading: initially the authors were asking for peer
    review, but these documents are now the de facto standards the Internet
    runs on.
}}

\newacronym{SQL}{Structured Query Language}{description={
    SQL is the standard language used for database querying, modification
    and maintenance.  Some information about SQL, including its history,
    can be found at \url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL}; a good
    introduction can be found at \url{http://philip.greenspun.com/sql/}.
}}

\newacronym{LMA}{Log Mail Analyzer}{description={
    One of the other Postfix log parsers reviewed and the only example of
    prior published paper~\cite{log-mail-analyser} found that specifically
    deals with parsing Postfix log files.
}}

\newacronym{CSV}{Comma-Separated Value}{description={
    The most basic form of database available, each record is a single line
    in the file and the fields are separated by a special character,
    typically a comma or colon.
}}


\newacronym{FQDN}{Fully Qualified Domain Name}{description={
    An FQDN is a hostname plus domain name, e.g.\ \newline{}
        example.com     is a domain name          \newline{}
        www             is a hostname             \newline{}
        www.example.com is a FQDN
}}

\newacronym{pid}{Process Identifier}{description={
    There may be multiple copies of any program executing at any one time,
    so the program's name is not suitable as a distinguishing identifier;
    instead each process executing is given a pid that is guaranteed to be
    unique for the lifetime of the process.  Once the process has
    completed, the pid may be reused, as they are drawn from a finite pool.
}}

\newacronym{UCE}{Unsolicited Commercial Email}{description={
    UCE is a more restrictive definition of spam than most people use: it
    only covers mail that is explicitly commercial, thus excluding viruses,
    Bayesian poisoning mails, backscatter, and those annoying chain letters
    you get from friends.
}}

% I think this is better than having both regex and regexes in the acronym
% list.  Likewise for pids.
\newcommand{\pids}{\pid{}s}

\newacronym{ESMTP}{Extended SMTP}{description={
    ESMTP is Extended SMTP, defined in RFC~1869~\cite{RFC1869}.
}}

\newacronym{IP}{Internet Protocol}{description={
    The Internet Protocol is the protocol used to communicate between
    computers on the Internet.  An IP address is a unique address assigned
    to a computer on the Internet, allowing it to communicate with other
    computers on the Internet.
}}

\newacronym{SLCT}{Simple Logfile Clustering Tool}{description={
    SLCT~\cite{slct-paper} is a tool implementing an algorithm designed by
    Risto Vaarandi for identifying, grouping and producing a regex to match
    similar log lines.
}}

\newacronym{ATN}{Augmented Transition Networks}{description={
    Augmented Transition Networks, originally described in~\cite{atns} and
    further in~\cite{nlpip}, are a tool used in Computational Linguistics
    for creating grammars to parse or generate sentences,
}}

\newacronym{CLI}{Command Line Interface}{description={
    An computer interface based on typing commands, rather than using a
    mouse.
}}

\newacronym{NLP}{Natural Language Processing}{description={
    Natural Language Processing~\cite{Wikipedia-nlp} attempts to increase
    our understanding of the languages normally used by humans (e.g.\
    English, Spanish, Japanese), with the goal of writing programs that
    can understand human languages.
