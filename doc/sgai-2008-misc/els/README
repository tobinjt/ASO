Elsevier's new document class for typeset journal articles,
elsarticle.cls, now available for user testing

Elsevier's document class for typeset articles elsart.cls is over 10
years old. Therefore it will be replaced with the newly written
document class elsarticle.cls, which was developed for Elsevier by the
leading TeX company River-Valley Technologies.

elsarticle.cls is based upon the standard LaTeX document class
article.cls. It uses natbib.sty for bibliographical references.

The following files are available:
- elsarticle.cls, the class file
- elsdoc.pdf, the user documentation
- elsarticle-template-num.tex, template file for numerical references
- elsarticle-template-harv.tex, template file for name-year references

Elsevier encourages authors to use this document class for testing,
and report bugs and problems to the developers of the class,
elsarticle@river-valley.com. It is the intention to finalize this
document class by the end of August. By that date it will be accepted
for submitted articles, both in Elsevier's electronic submission
system and otherwise.

Copyright 2007-2008, Elsevier. Bugs, feature requests, suggestions and
comments may be mailed to elsarticle@river-valley.com. elsarticle.cls,
related documentation and supporting packages are released under the
LATEX Project Public Licence, either version 1.3 or any later version.
This work has the LPPL maintenance status 'author-maintained'.
