<b>Abstract<p></b> Some parsers need to be very precise and strict in what they parse, yet must
allow users to easily adapt or extend the parser to parse new inputs, without requiring
that the user have an in-depth knowledge and understanding of the parser\'s internal
workings. This paper presents a novel parsing architecture which aims to make the
process of parsing new inputs as simple as possible, enabling users to trivially add
new rules (to parse variants of existing inputs) and relatively easily add new actions
(to process a previously unknown class of input). The architecture scales linearly
as the number of rules and/or size of input increases, making it suitable for parsing
large corpora or months of accumulated data.<p>
